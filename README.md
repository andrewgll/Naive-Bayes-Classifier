# Email classification using naive Bayes without any libraries. +Crafted dataset
This project is a simple implementation of a naive Bayesian classifier to distinguish between spam and ham.
The main goal of this work is just to have fun and learn, and to show that you can achieve a pretty decent result using only such a simple algorithm (about 90% accuracy).
(Of course, because of the NAIVE Bayes, it is quite easy to mess up this algorithm by simply spamming words from the ham category). Anyway, I like the results, and I hope you do too!
